# Custom-Cravings

## Introduction
Custom Cravings is a web application which allows users to find a selection of recipes based on their particular food preferences.

## The Aim of the Project
This project was created primarily to answer the problem of food wastage. It does this by providing meal ideas for people who need to make use of ingredients that they have remaining at home and do not know what to do with. The app, true to name, also allows people to respond to their particular cravings for a certain ingredient or type of cuisine. It has a curated list based on a mix of common ingredients and some that are more rare. This careful curation means the user is not overwhelmed by too many options. Using the application can help people to save money, because they can avoid eating out or buying more food when they are able to find inspiration to use ingredients that they already have. 

## User Story
As a user, I am an average person who needs to cook at home but is mindful of the need to save money due to rising living costs. I want to avoid food wastage and create meals based on foods I really enjoy. I may also have special dietary restrictions, such as intolerances or lifestyle-influenced food requirements such as vegetarianism or halal, that need to be catered for. 
As a user, I want assistance in finding inspiration for meal options which use ingredients that I already have at home. I want to be able to curate the list of recipes presented to me according to my food preferences and restrictions. I am busy and require a web application that is simple to use, requires no additional add-ons, and throws up a reasonable selection of recipe ideas quickly.

## How it Works
To use the application, a user goes to the URL and types their desired ingredient into the ‘search’ box. They will be presented with a list of recipes based on their food of choice. Their ‘favourite’ recipes can be saved on a separate page. 

## Technologies Used
Custom Cravings uses an API called Edamam, which links to a bank of thousands of recipes. A second API is used which was custom built by our team, which limits the search options to 143 ingredients. The languages and libraries used in the application's development are HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery and Bootstrap.

## Further Development
The application could be developed further by allowing users to select recipes based on further criteria such as a calorie threshold for users watching their calorie intake. The API could also be expanded to include more than the 143 ingredients it currently holds.
